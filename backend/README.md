# Full Stack Trivia API Web App

This is a second project submission to Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Program. This app is a game to answer questions, it also let's a user to add a question and filter the questions by category.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.

### Database Setup

With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

#### Backend

From the backend folder run `pip install requirements.txt`. All required packages are included in the requirements file.

To run the application run the following commands:

- For Windows users:

```
set FLASK_APP=flaskr
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

- For Mac users:

```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the `__init__.py` file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made.

The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend
configuration.

#### Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client:

```
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000.

#### Tests

In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:

```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command.

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality.

## API Reference

### Getting Started

- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. This app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/

### Error handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```
